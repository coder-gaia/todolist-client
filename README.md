# To-do List with React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a project for a challenge

## Explaning the functionalities

When you enter the project: - (https://todolist-client.vercel.app/todolist)

- You'll be in the signup page;
- You can wether create a new account or login in a existing one;
- After successfully logged in you'll have a jwt token that will serve as a key to perform all the actions in the table, then you're gonna see a table.;
- This table will show you all of your tasks, those you have finished ## done ## e and those you haven't ## pending ##
- If the table is empty you can create a new one, the design is very intuitve to do so;
- After you have created your very first to-do item, you can do whatever you want with it;
- The actions with the to-do items are: creation, deletion, update and reading;
- In the top, just below the header, there's an input searcher and a checkbox sercher;
- The checkbox has 2 options: done & pending, you can filter your tasks by it;
- The input itself will search the tasks by it's title, so you'll never lose track of any;
- There you go, your To-do List.

## This project was styled using Styled-Components
